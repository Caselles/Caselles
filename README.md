### Hugo Caselles-Dupré.

Artist at Obvious. We create Art with Machine Learning. Learn about us [here](http://obvious-art.com/).

Research Director at Obvious Research, a research laboratory we created. We work on Generative AI (image, video, sound) in partnership with ISIR (Sorbonne University). We have an ANR grant of over 1M€ to invent new AI algorithms for artistic creation (2023-2027). We are hiring interns, postdocs, research engineers and PhDs, contact me!

In 2021-2023, I did a Post-Doc at ISIR (Sorbonne University) under the supervision of Olivier Sigaud and Mohamed Chetouani, studying the teachability of autonomous agents.
In 2021, I graduated with a PhD from the Flowers Laboratory of ENSTA ParisTech and INRIA (supervised by David Filliat and Michaël Garcia-Ortiz). The title of my thesis is "On the Role of Action and Machine Learning in Artificial Agent Perception".
