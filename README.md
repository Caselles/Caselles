### Hugo Caselles-Dupré.

I'm currently a Post-Doc at ISIR (Sorbonne University) under the supervision of Olivier Sigaud and Mohamed Chetouani, studying the teachability of autonomous agents.

In 2021, I graduated with a PhD from the Flowers Laboratory of ENSTA ParisTech and INRIA (supervised by David Filliat and Michaël Garcia-Ortiz). The title of my thesis is "On the Role of Action and Machine Learning in Artificial Agent Perception".

I'm also co-founder of Obvious, a collective interested in Art & Machine Learning. You can learn more about us [here](http://obvious-art.com/).
